# UNSW-NB15-NIDS
This repository contains the UNSW-NB15 dataset, a comprehensive network traffic dataset designed for training and evaluating Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). The dataset includes a wide range of network traffic scenarios, making it a valuable resource for research and development in the field of cybersecurity and intrusion detection.

Our project's overarching goal is to develop a sophisticated Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that leverages ML and AI technologies to autonomously identify and alert users to unauthorized or suspicious activities within a computer network or system. With the ever-increasing sophistication of cyber threats, it's essential to have robust and intelligent defense mechanisms in place. Our IDS is designed to be that safeguard.
